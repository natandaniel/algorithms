## [_Bubble Sort_](https://github.com/natandaniel/algorithms_in_java/tree/master/algorithms_in_java/src/sort/bubble)

A bubble sort. Each iteration _"bubbles up"_ the biggest element of the array. If _N_ is the size of the array, only _N-1_ iterations are needed to sort the array, having _"bubbled up"_ the _N-1_ biggest elements and leaving the final, and least biggest element, in other words, the smallest element, in the initial postition of the array.
