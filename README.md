## [_Bubble Sort_](https://github.com/natandaniel/algorithms_in_java/tree/master/algorithms_in_java/src/sort/bubble)

A bubble sort. Each iteration _"bubbles up"_ the biggest element of the array. If _N_ is the size of the array, only _N-1_ iterations are needed to sort the array, having _"bubbled up"_ the _N-1_ biggest elements and leaving the final, and least biggest element, in other words, the smallest element, in the initial postition of the array.

## [_Insertion Sort_](https://github.com/natandaniel/algorithms_in_java/tree/master/algorithms_in_java/src/sort/insertion)

An insertion sort. Each iteration considers a subarray of the original array, starting with 1 element up to _N-1_ elements where _N_ is the size of the array to sort. Each subarray is considered to be sorted and the first element to the right of the array is **inserted** to its right place in the subarray.
